            <div class="card-container">
                <p>Hello and welcome to my teaching portfolio. Here you can see samples of my work as a teacher and as an instructional coach. I love my work — being able to help students learn and help educators teach is meaningful, enjoyable, and also just really interesting. Figuring out how to make the black box that is the human brain retain information and develop sophisticated skills is a challenge that never ends, and putting together lessons that are rich, rigorous, and fun lets me put my creative side to good use.</p>
                <p>The basics you might want to know: I've got experience teaching in IB MYP, Common Core, and Cambridge GCSE curricula. I've been teaching internationally for six years now, and I've got other educational experience as well — all that stuff is on the resume you can download below. Although I don't have the most experience in the world, I've managed to do a lot of different things in my career, like building teaching and admin tools with AI, serving on the Student Safeguarding team, working on standardized test prep, plus I've collected a fair amount of certifications along the way. Take a look around!</p>

                <p>For each unit I teach, I create a Knowledge Organizer. This has ideas, vocabulary words, background information, and anything else I want the students to retain after the unit. This isn't my idea, I stole it from a podcast I listened to. Knowledge organizers are great tools for quick revision with classes, steering my lesson planning, and giving the class a firm base for what we will learn.</p>
                <p>Here, you can see the knowledge organizer I made for the grade 7 unit on the genre of biography.</p>

            <div class="card-container">
                <p>As I mentioned in the section above, this year my grade 7 class learned about biography as a genre, exploring common features of the form and how writers can make biographical writing more interesting than just a recitation of facts.</p>
                <p>After reading short biographies and thinking about how this genre works, the students were tasked with writing their own biographies for a magazine the class put together. The process of assembling the magazine was wonderful to watch - the class had to work together, take on the various jobs at a magazine, such as editing, cover design, page layout, etc. You can see a sample of that work here - with pictures and student names removed, of course.</p>

                <p>In the 24-25 school year, I spent a good deal of time learning about Cognitive Load Theory. As an instructional coach, I wanted to share what I learned with my colleagues. I put together a series of short, 30-ish minute PD sessions, focusing on how theory could be helpful in the classroom.</p>
                <p>You can find slides from the first session of the series here, to get an idea of how I put together professional development materials.</p>

            <div class="card-container">
                <p>Using technology is necessary when teaching today, but ensuring it is used to further education and student thinking is tricky. Today more and more can be done to help teachers and to deliver learning experiences to students, but it needs to be done thoughtfully and with intention.</p>
                
                <p>I've built many tools to improve my workflow and to make administrative work easier for my colleagues. Here at my website, you can see how I've used the internet to supplement learning material, so please poke around at teachercolin.com to see one way I'm using tech to teach. EdTech is something I'm always happy to talk about - there's always more and more coming!</p>

            <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="card-container">
                <p>As a teacher and an instructional coach, I work to find the right mix of direct instruction and inquiry-based learning. This mix changes from person to person and from student to student; that's one reason this profession never gets stale. We need to meet everyone where they're at to help them move forward (to greatly simplify the work of Lev Vygotsky), so we have to look at people as individual learners as much as possible. It's not easy, and no one is perfect at it, but then again, if it was easy, what fun would that be?</p>
                
                <p>So how is it done? Its starts with building a classroom culture that embraces making mistakes. After all, that's how we learn new things - we try, we fail, we do it better next time. We build routines that reduce cognitive load. We discuss and share perspectives. We review and play games. We take what we've learned and apply it to new things in ways that are difficult. We celebrate our successes and we struggle through our challenges knowing that it's supposed to be hard. In my classroom, that's how we learn.</p>

            <div class="card-container">
                <p>As any teacher would say, words of appreciation from teachers are the best gift we can get. In the 24-25 school year, my school held a contest, asking students to create visual or written art about a teacher who impacted them. I was so grateful that a student I worked with the previous year wrote a poem about my time with her class. Now I'm not going to force anyone to read poetry, at least not outside of the classroom, but if you'd like to see it to get a sense of how I work with students in the classroom, you can click the button below.</p>
